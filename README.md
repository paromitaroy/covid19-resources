# Contribution

- Git clone https://github.com/paromitaroy/covid19-resources.git
- Update directly to the main branch 
- For simplicity purpose, I haven't set-up any policies
- The pipeline will run manually for now (as we are continuously building)
- As I get more contributors, we can come up with the best plan for release
- One environment only so keep that in mind
- I have seperated the pages as per city/places
