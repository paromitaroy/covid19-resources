# Contribution

- Git clone https://github.com/paromitaroy/covid19-resources.git
- Basic CSS+HTML site and nothing fancy, as we just need the information!!
- Update on a branch, we just have one environment only so keep that in mind :blush:
- For simplicity purpose, I haven't set-up any policies
- A [CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/paromitaroy/covid19-resources/blob/main/.github/workflows/azure.yml) has been set-up, it will trigger upon push/merge to the main branch
- As I get more contributors, we can come up with the best plan for release

- I have seperated the pages as per states/cities
